2- run install django file in this folder (windows only)
3- run runserver file (windows only)
4- go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/] use [user:admin  pass:admin] to add users, groups and permissions
5- go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/TimeSheet/] to login and start using the app

Preset users: [username:CEO  pass:x#$ELD_g.ufF25j] [username:HrAdmin  pass:6aiAzJpFg#!BZPV]

Permissions:
1- TimeSheet|extra permissions|can see all groups details without being part of them (thats a super admin permission inside the system which doesn't require the user to be part of any groups)
2- TimeSheet|extra permissions|can see his respective group(s) details (sets the user who has it as an admin to all the groups he belongs to)
